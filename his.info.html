      <h2>Historical info</h2>
      <p>Naawi-Oodena</p>
      <h2>Origins and Significance</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Treaty One</strong>: Signed on August 3, 1871, at Lower Fort Garry, Treaty One was the first of the numbered treaties in Canada. It involved the Anishinaabe and Swampy Cree peoples and the Canadian Crown.</li>
        <li><strong>Land Promises</strong>: The treaty promised each family of five 160 acres of land in exchange for ceding large portions of southern Manitoba to the Crown.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Kapyong Barracks Site</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Military Use</strong>: The land now known as Naawi-Oodena was occupied by the Canadian military's Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry until 2004.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Challenges</strong>: After the military vacated the site, the federal government attempted to sell the land without consulting the Treaty One First Nations, leading to legal disputes.</li>
        <li><strong>Court Rulings</strong>: In 2009, a Federal Court judge blocked the government's plans due to lack of consultation. The government lost subsequent appeals, and in 2015, it ceased further legal action.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Repatriation and Development</h2>
